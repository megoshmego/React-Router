Certainly! Here are the relevant code snippets from the script:

1. Importing and using the Switch component:
```javascript
// Importing the Switch component
import { Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

// Wrapping the routes in the Switch component
<Switch>
  {/* Route definitions */}
</Switch>
```

2. Rendering routes exclusively using the Switch component:
```javascript
// Example route configuration
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route exact path="/about" component={About} />
  <Route exact path="/contact" component={Contact} />
  <Route exact path="/blog/new" component={NewBlogForm} />
  <Route exact path="/blog/:slug" component={BlogPost} />
  <Route path="/blog" component={BlogHome} />
</Switch>
```

3. The order of routes matters when using the Switch component:
```javascript
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/blog/new" component={NewBlogForm} />
  <Route exact path="/blog/:slug" component={BlogPost} />
  <Route path="/blog" component={BlogHome} />
</Switch>
```

These snippets demonstrate how to use the Switch component from React Router. By wrapping the routes in the Switch component, only the first matching route will be rendered. This allows for exclusive routing, similar to server-side routing in frameworks like Flask or Express. It's important to pay attention to the order of routes within the Switch component, as the first matching route will be rendered. This ensures that more specific routes are matched before more general routes.
