Certainly! Here are the relevant code snippets from the script:

1. Wrapping components in a `MemoryRouter` for testing:
```javascript
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

// Wrap individual components using MemoryRouter
render(
  <MemoryRouter>
    <Nav />
  </MemoryRouter>
);
```

By wrapping the components that rely on React Router in a `MemoryRouter`, you ensure that the components have access to the necessary routing functionality, such as links and context, during testing.

2. Testing routes and navigation using `MemoryRouter`:
```javascript
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';

// Testing routes and navigation
test('Render about route', () => {
  render(
    <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/about']}>
      <App />
    </MemoryRouter>
  );

  expect(getByText('This is the about page')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test('Navbar links', () => {
  render(
    <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/']}>
      <App />
    </MemoryRouter>
  );

  expect(getByText('This is the homepage')).toBeInTheDocument();

  const link = getByText('Contact');
  fireEvent.click(link);

  expect(getByText('This is the contact page')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

In these examples, the `MemoryRouter` is used to set the initial route (`initialEntries`) for testing purposes. The components are rendered within the `MemoryRouter`, allowing the tests to verify the expected behavior when navigating to specific routes and interacting with links.

These code snippets demonstrate how to use the `MemoryRouter` from React Router to test components and routes in isolation, without relying on a real browser or external dependencies.
