Certainly! Here are the relevant code snippets from the script:

1. Using instance methods for event handlers in a class component:
```javascript
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
      isHiding: false
    };
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this);
    this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this);
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1
    }));
  }

  decrement() {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count - 1
    }));
  }

  //...
}
```

In this example, the event handler methods `increment` and `decrement` are defined as instance methods within the class component. In the constructor, `this.increment` and `this.decrement` are bound to the class instance using the `bind` method. This ensures that the value of `this` inside these methods refers to the component instance itself.

2. Using class fields (experimental syntax) for event handlers in a class component:
```javascript
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = {
    count: 0,
    isHiding: false
  };

  increment = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1
    }));
  };

  decrement = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count - 1
    }));
  };

  //...
}
```

In this example, the class fields syntax is used to define the event handler methods directly as arrow functions within the class component. This eliminates the need for a constructor and explicit binding using `bind`. The arrow functions automatically capture the correct value of `this` based on the lexical context.

These code snippets demonstrate two approaches to handling event handlers in class-based components. The first approach uses the `bind` method in the constructor to ensure the correct value of `this`, while the second approach utilizes the class fields syntax (experimental) to achieve the same result with less code.
