Certainly! Here are the relevant code snippets from the script:

1. Setting initial state in a class component:
```javascript
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
      isHiding: false
    };
  }

  //...
}
```

In this example, the initial state is set in the constructor of the class component using `this.state`. The `state` property is assigned an object with key-value pairs representing the initial state values. In this case, the state has `count` set to 0 and `isHiding` set to false.

2. Updating state in a class component:
```javascript
class Counter extends React.Component {
  //...

  incrementCount() {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1
    }));
  }

  //...
}
```

In this example, an event handler method named `incrementCount` is defined within the class component. When called, it uses `this.setState` to update the state. The `setState` method accepts an object representing the new state values to be merged into the existing state. In this case, the `count` value is incremented by 1 using the previous state value.

These code snippets demonstrate how to set and update state in a class-based component. The initial state is defined in the constructor, and state updates are done using the `setState` method, which allows for merging new state values into the existing state.
